# SQL_project_music_library
 I've been working on a project to create and manage a Music Library Database. The database consists of eleven interconnected tables, each containing essential information about various aspects of the music industry, such as artists, albums, tracks, genres, and more. Throughout the project, I've utilized various SQL query commands to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data effectively.
